Eye-Checkup
===========

Open Source Eye Checkup for Everyone.

==================================================================================================================================================
Eye-Checkup aims to be an open source eye checkup system. Using an Android/iOS handheld system, it uses the camera (preferably of high resolution) to analyse the user's eye from a close distance --- while the handheld system is tethered to a PC/larger screen where images are to be dispalyed which get blurred and sharp at certain time intervals. The handheld system analyses the eye (pupil, retina) with algorithms and tries to deliver the state of eye within the application after the 'checkup' is done.
